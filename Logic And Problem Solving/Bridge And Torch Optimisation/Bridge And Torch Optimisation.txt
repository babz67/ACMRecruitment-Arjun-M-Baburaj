Statement: Four people need to cross a narrow bridge at night, with only one torch. The torch is required for crossing. The four people take 1, 2, 7, and 10 minutes respectively to cross. The bridge can hold at most two people at a time, and when two people cross together, they must move at the pace of the slower person. If there are still people on the original side, someone must bring the torch back.


Assume player 1 takes 1 minutes to cross, player 2 takes 2 minutes, player 3 takes 7 minutes, and player 4 takes 10 minutes.

Also, give torch to player 1 as he takes least time amongst them all. He will be holding it throughout the crossing of the bridge.


Step 1: Player 1 accompany player 2, and they both cross the bridge taking 2 minutes. Now player two is on the other side, and player 1 takes the torch back in 1 minutes.

Time taken: 3 minutes
Total time: 3 minutes

Step 2: Player 1 now transports player 3 and returns.

Time taken: 8 minutes
Total time: 11 minutes

Step 3: Player 1 transports player 4.

Time taken: 10 minutes
Total time: 21 minutes


So, it takes 21 minutes to transport all the four players across the bridge.
