2, 6, 12, 20, ... is an progression. It is observed that natural multiples of 2 in increasing order is added to the preceding terms to create the next term of the sequence. The sequence starts from k, which is an arbitrary real constant.

For this specific sequence, k = 2


Adding 4, 6 is obtained, which is the 2nd term of the sequence. Similarly, 3rd and 4th terms can be verified.


Now,
	For 5th term, 10 is added to the 4th term 10, and it becomes 30.
	For 6th term, 12 is added to the 5th term 30, and it becomes 42.


So, the next two terms are 30 and 42. And the sequence becomes 2, 6, 12, 20, 30, 42, ...
