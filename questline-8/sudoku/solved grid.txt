Steps:
I put 3 in 4th row 4th column
I then put 4 in 3rd row 4th column, so 2 can be filled in 1st row 4th column
Then I filled the 2nd column 1st row with 4, so 1st column 1st row can be filled with 1
I put 2 in 1st column 2nd row, so 1st column 4th row is 4
Now, 2nd column 3rd row and 3rd column 4th row is 2 
Finally, in 3rd column, row 2 is 4 and row 3 is 1.
